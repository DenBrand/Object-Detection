In this experiment I try to find out if and in which extend the performances of yolov5 and the cascade classifier are influenced, if there is a fixed color for every detectable class and if there is none.

- data_collector should save images with both, fixed and randomized, object colors (but with the same perspective!)
- planned test set size ~400
- planned training set size >500
